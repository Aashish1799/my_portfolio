            <h3>1. IoT-Driven Smart Irrigation with Moisture-Dependent Pump Control for Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
            <p>In the face of climate change, depleting water
                resources, and the increasing demand for agricultural
                production, the efficient management of irrigation has become
                an urgent concern. Conventional irrigation methods often lead
                to excessive water consumption, resulting in environmental
                degradation and economic losses. Moreover, the
                unpredictability of weather patterns and shifting rainfall
                patterns compounds the issue, creating additional complexity
                as farmers find it challenging to adjust their irrigation
                strategies to cope with these variable conditions. This pressing
                problem necessitates innovative solutions to bridge the gap
                between water scarcity and the need for increased agricultural
                productivity. This paper brings forth the idea of an IoT-based
                smart irrigation system that integrates threshold values and
                real-time rainfall forecasts to address the fundamental
                challenges of water management in agriculture. By harnessing
                IoT technology, this system efficiently transmits sensor data to
                a cloud-based platform, providing an intuitive user interface
                for manual pump control. This system's incorporation of
                threshold values and user customizable automation has the
                potential to significantly reduce water wastage, enhance crop
                yields, and ultimately pave the way for a more sustainable and
                efficient approach to agriculture.</p>

            <h3>2. Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture Recognition</h3>
            <p>A method to put in force digital mouse through gadget imaginative and prescient are proposed. Firstly we present an green set of rules based totally on color to tune the movement of fingertips in real time, then we gift a fixed of messages (such as primary fingertip message and simulated mouse message) which can be generated according to the end result of fingertip tracking, These messages may be used to govern the window primarily based applications. We also present a framework to help programmers understand human-laptop interplay primarily based on digital mouse. The performance of digital mouse suggests a wonderful promise that we are able to be capable of use this technique to manipulate computers and gain a more natural human-laptop interaction</p>

            <h3>3.Real time security enhancement using the OpenCV and PyWhatKit modules.</h3>
            <p>A real time security enhancement from intruders
                without the use of any motion detection sensors. This is achieved
                using the OpenCV and PyWhatKit modules in Python. The model
                uses Webcam to detect image streams continuously using OpenCV
                module. Once any motion is detected an alert message is sent to the
                Adminâ€™s WhatsApp Number with the help of pywhatkit python
                library. This method reduces the cost as no sensors are used and also
                provides a fast and efficient security system solutions.</p>
